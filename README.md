# Adalo-Geolocation
This program is designed to work with the Adalo app builder and uses the Adalo Geolocation component to track and display the user's location on a map.

# Getting Started
To use this program, you will need to have an Adalo account and an app set up in Adalo. Once you have your app set up, follow these steps:

Open the Adalo app builder and navigate to the screen where you want to display the map.
Add a Map component to the screen and give it a name.
In the component settings, enable the Geolocation feature.
Open the screen's actions and add the "Get Geolocation" action to the "Screen Load" event. This will prompt the user for permission to access their location.
Add a list to the screen to display location data.
Set the list's data source to the "Geolocation" collection.
Add fields to the list to display the latitude, longitude, and address of each location.
